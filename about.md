Greetings! I am 26 years old and I started my coding journey only two years ago. I have been slowly going through schooling trying to figure out what I wanted to do with my life. Eventually I figured out something that I should have sooner then I want to admit and that is life doesn't actually give out any handouts. If I wanted to figure out what I wanted to do with my life I had to put in the work and try different things and see what interested me the most to try and chase. That is how I found way to computer science. I had always liked playing games when growing up and that eventually lead to me also just learning the basics around computers, which for some is something they didn't bother to do themselves, and for the most part that was all I had ever thought I was going to need to know. However, life turned out to thing differently as I again was sparked with interest to learn more about computers and that is what led me to where I am today.
