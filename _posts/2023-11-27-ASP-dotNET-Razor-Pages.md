This lab and post is way past due but sometimes life is a lttle funny in that we going to through some things and we just try to make the best of it and wait for it to pass.
...
For this lab I wanted to model something that does help me through all the hard times that I go through and that is music. Desipte the concept being very similar to that of the movies, which was done in the tutorial, I struggled with working on the music model all the same. I wanted to remove the price field from the movie model for my music one and wanted to replace that with a field where I could enter in the lenght of the song. I also wanted to change of the rating was done. I was not looking at if it was rated G or PG or anything like that anymore but I wanted to give personal ratings for it. Going through the code and switching over all the references points for when movies were mentioned or when pricing was mentioned was a long procees and it did trip me up sometimes scanning through all files to make sure I didn't miss any... but that was a process that went through about two extra rounds once I got further into the process as I had missed some that didn't get flagged as an error until later when I started to work acorss more files within the project. I think after having done this lab and actually finishing it I do have a better understanding of everything that is going on with one model in particual and what all is needed to make one work properly and the different aspects that are needed to reflect that on the website side of things.
