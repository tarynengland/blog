I know this post is way past due for when it was needed to be posted but I have had a rough time with staying on top of things for the last few weeks if I am going to be honest. 
At the point of Oct 25th when we were doing the Mockup presentations in class I had been apart of group converstaions about how the layout should look like. I was getting a sense of what the project would need in terms of stylistic needs more then anything as that is what my main role would be for the project.
