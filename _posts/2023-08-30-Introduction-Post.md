In this first post I will unfold the journey in which I took to even get to post here.

1. The setup trying to get this first post was very rough at first. I struggled a lot with getting the needed software downloaded where it needed to get downloaded and really felt defeated. After a couple hours of trying and not getting anywhere I had to step away and work on other things that were needing to get down and I knew I could do. After wrapping the other work I decided to get some food and hoped that with some food in my system I might be able to come back to trying things working and it would be less defeating. To my surprise I was right!

2. I have written a blog post before so the idea of blogging isn't new to me but I have never written a blog post in this manner of coding it. I have used blog websites before and I just had to write into the text field and the website took care of everything after I hit post.

3. I feel like over the course of the next few months I will learn and understand more on the nature of what is actually going on between what I see on my local computer and how that gets posted on the internet for anyone to be able to see around the world. It still is a little foggy on what is actually happening behind the scenes.

A few links that proved helped during the journey:
