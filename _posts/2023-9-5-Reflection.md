For a calming listen as you look over the post let me suggest listening to some Ambience music by Ambient Worlds.

In this updating of the blog it was a challenge trying to figure out which parts of the jekyll code was pertaining to what part of the layouts. I found it very hard at times to see what was being coded at certain points and how that translate onto the blog itself.

It is still new to me how it went about styling the blog through the abstrations. How it is able to change in many sections of the blog by only needing to reference a certain part that for some of it wasn't even in the same location as the rest of the code for a certain change.

I still have trouble trying to also follow the paths in which things are really located in relation to how they are then set up. I am still optomistic on finding out how it works more and learning where things are actually located in order to make more stylized changes and it acutally work the way I wanted it to.

This is how I have to tell myself I can do it.

Yet this is how I often find myself shortly after starting something.
