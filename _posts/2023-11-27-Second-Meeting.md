As of the Nov 13th when my group presented for the second time I had attended both client meetings and been in talks about what the group was doing for the project. I was still in my personal slump during that time so I had not done much more at the time aside from being a part of the talks about what was going to be done for the project. I was trying to also catch up on work that I had not finished so that I could potentially be more active in the group work before too long and it felt like I was doing absolutely nothing, which at the point it was looking like that and even felt like it. I still plan to turn all my attention to now working on adding sytle to the website now that I have caught up on my outstanding assignments for the class. I know I have a lot to make up for as I have been not pulling my weight all that much so far for this project.
